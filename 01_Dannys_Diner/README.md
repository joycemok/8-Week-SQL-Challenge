## Business Goal
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Case Study Questions

### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

**Process:**
- **JOIN** ```dannys_diner.sales``` with  ```dannys_diner.menu``` to get ```sales.customer_id``` from sales table and ```menu.price``` from menu table
- Use **SUM** to add item prices together
- Group the total prices by ```sales.customer_id``` to get amount each customer spent
  
``` SQL
    SELECT sales.customer_id, SUM(menu.price) as total_price
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
    GROUP BY sales.customer_id
    ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```

**Answer:**

| customer_id | total_price |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

- Customer A spent a total of $76
- Customer B spent a total of $74
- Customer C spent a total of $36

---
### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

**Process:**
- Notice that the question asks for days meaning if a customer visited multiple times a day it should be counted only once, so to account for this we can use **COUNT(DISTINCT order_date)** to avoid duplicate counts of visits on the same day
    
``` SQL
    SELECT sales.customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT sales.order_date)
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
    GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
```

**Answer:**

| customer_id | count |
| ----------- | ----- |
| A           | 4     |
| B           | 6     |
| C           | 2     |

- Customer A visited 4 times
- Customer B visited 6 times
- Customer C visited 2 times

---
### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

**Process:**
- Create a CTE (Common Table Expression) called ```cte_rank``` to order the items purchased by each customer by ```sales.order_date```
- Use **DENSE_RANK()** to rank the orders by ```sales.order_date```  to get ranking where duplicate order dates get equivalent rank values
- Use **PARTITION BY** ```sales.customer_id``` to create groupings for each customer allowing us to get the first item for each customer
- **SELECT** the entries where ```date_rank = 1``` for each customer

``` SQL
    WITH cte_rank AS (
    SELECT sales.customer_id, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS date_rank, menu.product_name, sales.order_date
    FROM dannys_diner.sales 
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu 
      ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
    ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC, date_rank ASC
    )
    SELECT customer_id, product_name
    FROM cte_rank
    WHERE date_rank = 1
    GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;
```

**Answer:**

| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | curry        |
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | curry        |
| C           | ramen        |

- Customer A purchased curry and sushi first
- Customer B purchased curry first
- Customer C purchased ramen first

---
### 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

**Process:**
- **COUNT** ```menu.product_name``` and **GROUP BY** ```menu.product_name``` to get count of purchases for each item
- Use ```LIMIT 1``` to get most purchased item

``` SQL
    SELECT menu.product_name, COUNT(menu.product_name) AS total_sales
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
    GROUP BY menu.product_name
    ORDER BY total_sales DESC
    LIMIT 1;
```

**Answer:**

| product_name | total_sales |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| ramen        | 8           |

- Ramen was the most purchased item with 8 sales

---
### 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

**Process:***
- Create CTE to get the number of each item purchased by each customer, as the number of times an item is purchased will be our measure of 'popularity'
- Use **DENSE_RANK()** to get a rank of each item ```ORDER BY``` the number of times each item was purchased
- **PARTITION BY** ```sales.customer_id``` to rank how many times each item is purchased for each customer
- **SELECT** the most popular item for each customer

``` SQL
    WITH pop_items AS (
    SELECT sales.customer_id, menu.product_name, COUNT(menu.product_name) AS product_count, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY COUNT(sales.customer_id) DESC) AS count_rank
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
    GROUP BY sales.customer_id, menu.product_name
    )
    SELECT customer_id, product_name, product_count
    FROM pop_items
    WHERE count_rank = 1
    ORDER BY customer_id ASC, product_count DESC;
```

**Answer:**

| customer_id | product_name | product_count |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| A           | ramen        | 3             |
| B           | ramen        | 2             |
| B           | curry        | 2             |
| B           | sushi        | 2             |
| C           | ramen        | 3             |

- Ramen was the most popular item for Customer A
- Ramen, curry, and sushi were equally popular for Customer B
- Ramen was the most popular item for Custoemr C

### 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

**Process:**
- Create CTE that selects purchases of each customer **ORDER BY** ```sales.order_date```
- Use **PARTITION BY** ```sales.customer_id``` to group customers and apply **DENSE_RANK()** to each customer partition to rank the order dates from first purchase to latest purchase
- Exclude orders purchased before each customer's membership date 

``` SQL
    WITH first_purchase AS (
    SELECT sales.customer_id, menu.product_name, sales.order_date, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS date_rank
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
    WHERE sales.order_date > members.join_date
    )
    SELECT customer_id, product_name
    FROM first_purchase
    WHERE date_rank = 1;
```

**Answer:**

| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | ramen        |
| B           | sushi        |

- The first order purchased by Customer A after becoming a member was ramen
- The first order purchased by Customer B after becoming a member was sushi

---
### 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

**Process:**
- Create CTE that selects purchases of each customer **ORDER BY** ```sales.order_date``` latest to earliest
- Use **PARTITION BY** ```sales.customer_id``` to group customers and apply **DENSE_RANK()** to each customer partition to rank the order dates from first purchase to latest purchase
- Exclude dates after customers became a member

``` SQL
    WITH bf_membership AS (
    SELECT sales.customer_id, menu.product_name, sales.order_date, members.join_date, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id ORDER BY sales.order_date DESC) AS date_rank
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
    WHERE sales.order_date < members.join_date
    )
    SELECT customer_id, product_name
    FROM bf_membership
    WHERE date_rank = 1;
```

**Answer:**

| customer_id | product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | sushi        |
| A           | curry        |
| B           | sushi        |

- Customer A purchased sushi and curry right before becoming a member
- Customer B purchased sushi right before becoming a member

---
### 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

**Process:**
- Only include purchases before customers became members ```sales.order_date < members.join_date```
- Use **COUNT(product_id)** to get total number of items purchased and **SUM(price)** to get total price of the items purchased
- **GROUP BY** ```sales.customer_id``` to get number of items purchased and total price for each customer

``` SQL
    SELECT sales.customer_id, COUNT(menu.product_id) AS item_count, SUM(menu.price) AS total_price
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
    INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
    	AND sales.order_date < members.join_date
    GROUP BY sales.customer_id
    ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC;
```

**Answer:**

| customer_id | item_count | total_price |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| A           | 2          | 25          |
| B           | 3          | 40          |

- Customer A purchased 2 items for a total price of $25 before becoming a member
- Customer B purchased 3 items for a total price of $40 before becoming a member

### 9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?

**Process:**
- For items that are not sushi **$1 = 10 points**
- For items that are sushi **$1 = 20 points**
- Using the conditional **CASE** statement:
  - **IF** product_id = 1 (sushi), multiply every $1 by 20 points.
  - **ELSE** multiply $1 by 10 points.
- Calculate the total points for each customer

``` SQL
    WITH order_points AS (
    SELECT sales.customer_id, 
    	CASE
        	WHEN menu.product_id = 1 THEN menu.price * 10 * 2
            ELSE menu.price * 10
        END AS points
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
    )
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(points)
    FROM order_points
    GROUP BY customer_id
    ORDER BY customer_id ASC;
```

**Answer:**

| customer_id | sum |
| ----------- | --- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
| C           | 360 |

- Customer A earned a total of 860 points
- Customer B earned a total of 940 points
- Customer C earned a total of 360 points

---
### 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

**Process:**
- Create CTE that calculates when double points occur
- Use **CASE** statements with this logic:
  - **IF** order is within within a week of the member's join date then 2x points for all items
  - **IF** item is sushi then 2x points
  - **ELSE** $1 = 10 points
- Exclude dates after January 31st
- Calculate the total points for each customer

``` SQL
    WITH double_points AS (
    SELECT sales.customer_id, 
    	CASE
        	WHEN sales.order_date BETWEEN members.join_date AND members.join_date + 6 THEN menu.price * 10 * 2
      		WHEN sales.product_id = 1 THEN menu.price * 10 * 2
      		WHEN sales.order_date > '2021-01-31' THEN menu.price * 0
            ELSE menu.price * 10
        END AS points
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
    LEFT JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
    INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
    )
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(points)
    FROM double_points
    GROUP BY customer_id
    ORDER BY customer_id ASC;
```

**Answer:**

| customer_id | sum  |
| ----------- | ---- |
| A           | 1370 |
| B           | 820  |

- Customer A earned a total of 1370 points
- Customer B earned a total of 820 points
