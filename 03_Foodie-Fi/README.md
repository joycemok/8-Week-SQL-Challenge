## Business Goal
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world! He created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data.

INNER JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions AS sub
  ON plans.plan_id = sub.plan_id
