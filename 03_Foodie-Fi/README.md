<img src = "https://github.com/joycemok/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/assets/107952129/05d3f533-ff3f-4fb6-a2b4-e83000c2e7ff" width = 550, height = 550>

## Business Goal
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world! He created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data.

We are going to join the ```subscription``` table and the  ```plan``` table with the 8 customers selected:

```SQL
SELECT sub.customer_id, plans.plan_id, plans.plan_name, sub.start_date

INNER JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions AS sub
  ON plans.plan_id = sub.plan_id
WHERE sub.customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19)
ORDER BY sub.customer_id ASC, plans.plan_id ASC;
